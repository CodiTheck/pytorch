**PyTorch** is an open source deep learning framework built to be flexible and
modular for research, with the stability and support needed for production
deployment. PyTorch provides a Python package for high-level features like
tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and TorchScript
for an easy transition between eager mode and graph mode.
With the latest release of PyTorch, the framework provides graph-based
execution, distributed training, mobile deployment, and quantization.
